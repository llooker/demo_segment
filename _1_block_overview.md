Companies can track customer data with Segment’s easy-to-use libraries and send it on to their favorite tools and data warehouse to analyze in Looker. Customers get access to the following products with a Free, Standard, or Business plan:  

* [Integrations](https://segment.com/integrations): Segment can send data to more than 180 marketing and analytics tools. Rather than instrumenting tracking code for each tool, companies track their data once with Segment’s event collection libraries. They can simply enable tools in their dashboard, and Segment sends that data to each tool in the format they understand.

* [Sources](https://segment.com/sources): Customers can collect data from cloud apps like Salesforce, Zendesk, and Intercom alongside their web or mobile app event data. Sources lowers the barrier for adding new dimensions to customer data in a clean, structured format with no engineering work – customers only have to enter their credentials in Segment and save. 

* [Warehouses](https://segment.com/warehouses): All Segment customers can use Segment Warehouses to load their customer event data and cloud app data into a connected Redshift or Postgres data warehouse to start analyzing it in Looker. Segment will pipe data into a customer’s self-hosted warehouse or will host warehouses for enterprise customers.
